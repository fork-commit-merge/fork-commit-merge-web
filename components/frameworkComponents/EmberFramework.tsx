                    Ember.js is a productive, battle-tested JavaScript framework
                    for building modern web applications. It includes everything
                    you need to build rich UIs that work on any device. With
                    scalable UI architecture baked-in from the start, you'll be
                    working with the same patterns these organizations use every
                    step of the way.

                    Ember Best Practices
                </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        - Emphasize the use of Ember Data for managing data in
                        your application. It simplifies data handling and
                        maintains data consistency effectively.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - Make it a point to follow Ember's established naming
                        and coding conventions. This practice will make your
                        code more understandable and easier to maintain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - Embrace Ember's component-based architecture. It
                        allows you to create modular and reusable UI elements,
                        making your development process more efficient.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        - Develop a thorough testing strategy. This should
                        include unit, integration, and acceptance tests to
                        ensure your Ember application is reliable and robust.
